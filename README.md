# Supervised_Learning_in_Depth
This is a notebook where I did Supervised Learning on MNIST dataset. Here I have used Linear Support Vector Machine with variation in C values, Polunomial Kernel Classifier with different values of d, Random Forest Classifier for different no. of trees, OnevsRest Classifier, Pair-wise Classifier, Voting Classifier for Majority Voting Classifier.
